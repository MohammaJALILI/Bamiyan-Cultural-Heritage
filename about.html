      <h2>Bamiyan Valley</h2>
      <p>The Bamiyan Valley, enclosed in the high mountains of the Hindu Kush in central highlands of Afghanistan, was a vital link in the trade routes that spanned from China to India via ancient Bactria (present-day Afghanistan). 
        The valley, at an altitude of 2,500 metres, follows the line of the Bamiyan River, and has been inhabited since at least the 3rd century BC. The passage of merchants through this natural corridor from the earliest days of the
        Silk Roads brought languages, beliefs and traditions together here, and contributed to its development as a major religious and cultural centre throughout the Middle Ages.</p>

          <h2>Buddhas of Bamiyan </h2>
          <p>The Buddhas of Bamiyan were two possibly 6th-century monumental Buddhist statues in the Bamiyan Valley of Afghanistan. Located 130 kilometres (81 mi) to the northwest of Kabul at an elevation of 2,500 metres (8,200 ft), 
            carbon dating of the structural components of the Buddhas has determined that the smaller 38 m (125 ft) "Eastern Buddha" was built around 570 CE, and the larger 55 m (180 ft) "Western Buddha" was built around 618 CE, which would date both to 
            the time when the  Hephthalites ruled the region. As a UNESCO World Heritage site of historical Afghan Buddhism, it was a holy site for Buddhists on the Silk Road However, in March 2001, both statues were destroyed by the Taliban following an order from their leader Mullah Muhammad Omar; 
            the Taliban government of the Islamic Emirate had condemned the Bamiyan Buddhas as idols, invoking the Muslim concept of shirk International and local opinion strongly condemned the destruction of the Buddhas. </p>

          <h2>Band-e Amir National Park</h2>
          <p>Band-e Amir National Park is a national park in Afghanistan. It was established on 22 May 2009 as Afghanistan's first national park to promote and protect the natural beauty of a series of intensely blue lakes created by natural
            dams high in the Hindu Kush Band-e-Amir is a chain of six lakes in the mountainous desert of central Afghanistan. The lakes formed from mineral-rich water that seeped out of faults and cracks in the rocky landscape.
             Over time, the water deposited layers of hardened mineral (travertine) that built up into walls that now contain the water. According to the Wildlife conservation Society (WCS), who helped the  Afghan government set up the park, Band-e-Amir is one of the few travertine systems in the world. 
             They were created by the carbon dioxide rich water oozing out of the faults and fractures to deposit calcium carbonate precipitate in the form of travertine walls that today store the water of these lakes. Band-e Amir is one of 
             the few rare natural lakes in the world which are created by travertine systems. The site of Band-e Amir has been described as Afghanistan's Grand Canyon National Park and draws more than 100,000 local and foreign tourists annually. The river is part of the system of the Balkh River.
